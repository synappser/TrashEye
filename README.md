## FAQ

Yes, TrashEye is free while it's in beta.

## Features

- Sliding the switch to On in the Preferences window, displays a Trash icon in the bottom left corner of your Desktop
- A single click (left-click) on TrashEye's icon opens the Bin folder
- Right-clicking on the Trash Can opens a contextual menu
- To reposition the Trash on your Desktop click the Reposition Trash menu item. This action will reveal its background view, allowing you to grab it and move it to your liking
- "Force Empty Trash" deletes locked files. It auto-detects if Touch ID is enabled for sudo and adapts its strategy accordingly (see below for a Howto):
  - [How to enable Touch ID for sudo on MacBook Pro](https://azimi.io/how-to-enable-touch-id-for-sudo-on-macbook-pro-46272ac3e2df)

- Dragging items on to TrashEye's Desktop icon adds them to the trash
